When it comes to submitting a proposal for a conference presentation, it's essential to define your target audience. Knowing who you are speaking to can help you tailor your presentation to the audience's needs, interests, and background knowledge. In this post, we will discuss how to define your target audience for a conference proposal and why it matters.

## Consider their Job Role
First, you need to consider the job role of your target audience. Are they data scientists, machine learning or software engineers, researchers, or something else?

Knowing their job role can help you determine what topics and techniques are most relevant to them.

For example, if you present a new data visualization technique, data scientists and researchers may be more interested in how it works.

At the same time, engineers may be more interested in how it can be implemented in their existing systems.

## Think about Experience
Next, consider the experience level of your target audience. Are they beginners, intermediate, or advanced in the subject matter?

This will affect how you present your ideas and how much background information you provide.

For example, suppose your presentation is on a complex algorithm. In that case, an advanced audience may be interested in the technical details and code examples. At the same time, beginners may need a simplified explanation of the concepts to follow the presentation.

## Consider a Secondary Niche
Believe me, I love talking about machine learning. But when people don't know me, they're unlikely to be interested in that talk.

However, you could talk about "machine learning in medicine" or "applying neural networks in weather and climate prediction", making the talk a must-watch for certain people who might have missed the proposal otherwise.

This is a way to tell your target audience exactly that a presentation is for them.

## Why do we define our Target Audience?
Defining your target audience is crucial for two main reasons.

First, it helps you focus your presentation on the most relevant and interesting topics for your audience. This can make your presentation more engaging and valuable for attendees.

Second, it helps potential attendees decide if your presentation matches their needs and interests.

Suppose they can easily see that your presentation targets their job role and experience level. In that case, they are more likely to attend and find value in your talk.

## Consider the Conference itself
When writing your conference proposal, make sure to include information about your target audience.

This could be as simple as including a statement like "This presentation is targeted towards data scientists with intermediate experience level." Providing this information can help reviewers and attendees understand who your talk is for and whether it aligns with the goals of the conference.

## Conclusion
Defining your target audience is an essential step in preparing a conference presentation. By considering your audience's job role and experience level, you can tailor your presentation to their needs and interests, making it more engaging and useful for attendees. Be sure to include information about your target audience in your conference proposal to help reviewers and attendees understand who your talk is for and whether it's a good fit for them.
