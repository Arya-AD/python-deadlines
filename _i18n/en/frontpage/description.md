This community tool serves as a central repository for deadlines of calls for participitation, proposals, workshops, and tutorials at Python conferences.

The dates are made available as countdowns, in local timezones and even as a Google calendar below!

Deadlines are shown in <span class="local-timezone">your local</span> time. To view them in conference website timezones, click on the conference.

You can optionally export all deadlines to
<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid={{ site.url }}/{{ site.github_repo }}.ics">Google Calendar</a> or
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.github_repo }}.ics">iCal</a>.
