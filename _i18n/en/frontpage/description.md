This community tool serves as a central repository for deadlines of calls for participitation, proposals, workshops, and tutorials at Python conferences.

The dates are made available as countdowns, in local timezones and even as a Google calendar below!

Deadlines are shown in <span class="local-timezone">your local</span> time. To view them in conference website timezones, click on the conference.
